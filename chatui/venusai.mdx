## About Venus AI

Venus AI is a roleplay platform that lets you create and interact with custom or pre-existing characters.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:  
1. Venus AI account
2. API key from ClashAI

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create account and get API key">
  To create an account, go to https://venuschat.ai/register, then fill in all the required fields. 
  
  After that you need to get a clashai api key.
  For this, you need to join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yyfGnyKj9j) and go to the [Dashboard channel](https://discord.com/channels/1231339329435996280/1302343342746505347).

  On the left sidebar, find the section labeled **"Manage API Key".** Here, you’ll click on **"Generate"** where your unique API key awaits—ready to unlock your explorations.
